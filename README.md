# Non/low-Code Repository

This repository serves as a structured documentation of my continuous learning journey across different tools and domains. Each folder focuses on a specific area of practice, containing exercises, case-based examples, and supporting files. The goal is to create a well-organized archive that reflects both technical exploration and applied understanding.

## Repository Structure

* **excel-track/**
  Contains exercises and examples of structuring, analyzing, and visualizing data using Microsoft Excel. Topics include table management, formula applications, pivot tables, and reporting workflows.

* **erp-track/**
  Materials related to enterprise systems and resource planning concepts. Includes case notes, practice tasks, and scenario-based documentation exploring how ERP supports business processes.

* **powerpoint-track/**
  Slide design exercises, storytelling practice, and documentation of presentation workflows. Includes modern, minimalist slide redesigns and examples of translating case content into effective visual formats.

## Purpose

The repository is not intended to be a portfolio of finished projects but rather a curated record of structured learning. Each folder reflects a theme of practice, with emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and progressive improvement.
